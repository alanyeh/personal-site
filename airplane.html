								<p>
									Having done a ton of traveling over the past three years, I’ve had my share of stressful airport experiences. From nearly missing my flight to canceled/delayed flights. The experience of airports for most people is without a doubt stressful. However, air travel shouldn’t be so nerve-racking. From boarding to arrive, there are plenty of rooms for improving the experience of air travel.
									One of the biggest opportunities for elevating this stress is providing the passenger with adequate flight information. That starts with the airplane ticket.

										Let me start off with a typical boarding ticket...<br/><br/>

										This is a standard boarding ticket you may get at any airline. Overall, the ticket is hard to read, important information isn't visually available - information can get easily mixed up. And if you're in a hurry, you'll easily miss your flight. </p>

										<h3 class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">Version 1</h3>
										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
											I focused on making the most important information legible. Then, I added a die-line that indicates a place to be torn/folded separating the information into two sections. However, the boarding information on the right seemed awkward and unbalanced. I was also missing the date of arrival, and the overall information is still scattered.
										</p>

										<h3 class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">Version 2</h3>
										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
											I wanted to make it a little more legible by setting the copy vertically to see how it presented. Also, I added a QR code instead of a barcode, as scanners these days seem to prefer QR codes.
										</p>

										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
											This is the final boarding pass. I went with the vertical boarding pass, since most airline systems only printed this style of tickets. Left is pre-flight information from reaching the terminal to boarding. The right side is all the information after boarding. The center die-line is the foldable area, that can be torn off by the attendant. The color is black and white to make it easy to print on any printer.
										</p>
										<img src="img/airplane_ticket.png"/>

										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
											Here's the finished design. In version one, I had the barcode in the center. Which didn't make sense, if the die-line was torn, it could have tore the barcode off. It makes sense to put the barcode on the left side. If I was handing the ticket facing me with my right hand, then the barcode would be facing away from the flight attendant and towards the scanner.
										</p>
										<img src="img/ticket.jpg"/>

										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">
											I decided to convert my paper ticket to a virtual ticket.<br /><br/>

											The key benefits of having a virtual ticket on your phone is the ability for the company to update your flight status as it changes. I took the concept of arranging the important information first. I also decided to have the barcode at the top, even though it looks awkward for usability sake. When the flight attendant scans the barcode you can just face the screen towards them while you hold it. The barcode would then be closer to the flight attendant scanning the tickets.
										</p>

										<h3 class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">Challenges </h3>

										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">The spacing seems awkward, especially if I wanted to have another relevant changes to the flight. The "*Gate change" annotation seems out of place.</p>

										<h3 class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">Further Ideas</h3>

										<p class="caption col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-8 col-lg-8">As I was working on this, it could be beneficial for relevant ads that can benefit the place the ticket holder is traveling to. For example, if they wanted to rent a car in Bombay, there could be ads targeting the user of car rental services in the area. <br/><br/>

										Also, we could include crowd source information on the flight, such as what types of food menu items are good, or just other advice on the flight in general by previous passengers.
